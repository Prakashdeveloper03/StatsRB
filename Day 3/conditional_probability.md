### Task:
Suppose a family has **2** children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

### Solution:

Out of **2** children, one is boy, therefore we will not include `(g, g)` in our sample space.
- Sample space (Ω): `{(b, b), (b, g), (g, b)}`
- Event A := "Both are boys": `{(b, b)}`
- P(A): `|A| / |Ω|` = `1/3`

Probability that both children are boys is **`1/3`**
